# Project Aims and Motivation
For my project I would like to use Python to implement Excel functionality into LabVIEW, 
which I have already started looking at so I have a slight headstart here!

The native LabVIEW Excel code is very buggy and unreliable, causing Excel to crash 
randomly and inconsistently. However, I have used Python for Excel before with the 
openpyxl package.

LabVIEW allows "Python Nodes" to access Python functions, with arguments limited to 
specific types (e.g. float, int, string, array - not numpy arrays).
